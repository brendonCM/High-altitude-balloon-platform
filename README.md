The high altitude platform file contains the Code and the CAD models.
The code was created using Visual GDB, which automatically created the Makefile. Visual GDB used the MSBuild to run the code on the linux system.
The main code for all the devices to interface with the pocketbeagle is located in the main folder.
The CAD models were created using Solidworks.
